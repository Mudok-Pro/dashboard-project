# dashboard-project
in this project the first thing we gonna do is the making a plan
1:Layout
the first thing is writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar,header,and main-content containers
then in the CSS file apply the Grid properties until we have the basic layout built 
2:Nesting 
one section at a time nest child elements under the parent elements in the HTML
on side bar use more grids to layout the navigation and branding sections
in the header ,use more grids to lay out the search bar , user info and buttons 
for main content use more grids to layout the projects , annoncements and trending items
fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so we can position all of grid items 
3:Gather assets 
once we have the grid layout complete recreate the dashboard example above or style your owwn design
all of the icons and more can be downloaded as SVGs
choose the fonts 
5: tips 
when building the layout apply background colors or borders to yourcontainers to help you visualize your grid
